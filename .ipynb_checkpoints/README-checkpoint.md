# Instructions
## Data processing code

 1. ECG_MIT_1D_dataprocessing_125Hz.ipynb: Process data into 1D 125 Hz train/test (for both inter and intra patient paradigm for Kachuee paper replication
 2. ECG_MIT_1D_dataprocessing_360Hz.ipynb: Process data into 1D 360 Hz train/test (for both inter and intra patient paradigm for Redhame paper replication
 3. ECG_MIT_2D_STFT_dataprocessing_360Hz.py: Process data into 2D STFT images and label for our proposed method

## Model train/test code

 1. Kachuee_paper_replication.ipynb: Train and test Kachuee model for both inter and intra patient paradigm
 2. Redhame_paper_replication.ipynb: Train and test Redhame model for both inter and intra patient paradigm
 3. STFT_Resnet: Train and test our proposed model for inter patient paradigm
